# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Challenge

## Description

As a web developer I am entitled to refractor older code to help build or improve the efficiency of its footprint on the web.
 By making the website more user friendly and accessible we can help improve its visability to the public and this motivated me to 
 revise and build a more efficient code. The changes included are as follows:

 * Give HTML5 and CSS semantic structure
 * Give the webpage a more welcoming name 
 * Give the page a header and a footer 
 * Added alts to images 
 * Significantly consolidate CSS
 * Comment and indent code
